# Junior Web Developer | My CV
> A simple page with my CV details for future IT job hunting. This serves as a subpage to the portfolio project but I have decided to create it as a separate.

## Table of contents
* [General info](#general-info)
* [Technologies](#technologies)
* [Status](#status)
* [Inspiration](#inspiration)

## General info
The webpage is a simple resume with information about my work experience, education, skills and finished IT courses.

## Technologies
* HTML 5
* CSS

## Setup
[github pages link](https://nikara4.github.io/MyCV/)

## Status
Project is: completed.

**Update 25/05/2022**: Added new courses anchanged styles to match the new portfolio.

**Update 25/09/2021**: Added new courses and linked certificates of completion.

**Update 09/05/2021**: Adjusted media queries to work on 1366px resolution on desktop. This resolution was previously untouched and it resulted in a couple errors with float property.

I do not intend to add any interactive features on this page. I will expand skills and courses sections as I go.

## Inspiration
This project is based on the final excercise from the course: Web developer od podstaw w 15 dni - [Samuraj Programowania](https://websamuraj.pl/)
I have taken the inspiration from the CV template made by [@ritaly](https://github.com/ritaly). I recommend her blog for more information and mini courses: [Fly Nerd](https://www.flynerd.pl/).
